This is just a test,

I was testing publishing an npm package. Also I was testing getting the Editor in Primereact to work with NEXT.js
This is a fork of primereact v 6.2.1
The only difference is the Editor doesn't try to import the CSS from quill.
If you use this and want the Editor to work correctly you will have to import the quill CSS into your project in NEXT.js's `_app.js` 

This issue should not exists in primereact v 6.2.2 

please don't use this package. Just use primereact.
